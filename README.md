# japan-population-chropleth
ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µðŸ—¾ with some ðŸš‰train station data against 2016 population data.

## I wanted to figure out how to use Shapefile with ggplot.
So here's some experiment using few different data source.

### Shapefile for Japan 
I've downloaded shapefile from Esri site. https://www.esrij.com/products/japan-shp/
This shapefile had population data from 2016. So I've used this data to colour each section of map. 

### Train Station Data from Ekidata
I wanted to figure out if I can overlay location data on top of chropleth map, so I've decided to use train station location to overlay.  http://www.ekidata.jp/


## Chropleth Map of Japan (coloured with population data from 2016 Jan 1st)
